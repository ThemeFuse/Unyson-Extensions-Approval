Unyson Extensions Developer Approval
====================================

Unyson has many extensions that help developers build powerful WordPress themes.

The problem is that once a developer creates a theme and uploads it on a marketplace he can't control the compatibility of different extensions updates that we usually release. These updates might contain changes that is possible to break something in their theme.

This repository tries to solve this problem by allowing developers to test and approve a new extension update before we release it for public download.

How it works
------------

Every time a new extension version is ready for release, an issue with all details about it will be created in this repository. The issue will be open for a couple of days in order for developers to get a chance to test the new extension version on their themes and give us feedback. If everything is ok, the new extension will be released and will appear as an update to all Unyson users.
