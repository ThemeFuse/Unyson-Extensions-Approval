Unyson Extensions Approval
==========================

Unyson has many awesome extensions that help developers build powerfull themes.

The problems is, once a developer created a theme and placed it on a marketplace
he can't control the new extension versions that are going to be released
which may contain some changes that will break something in their theme.

This repository solves the problem and allows developers to test and aprove 
a new extension version before it will be released.

How it works?
-------------

Every time a new extension version is finished for release, 
in this repository will be created an issue with details about it.
The issue will be open for some time, so theme developers will be able to test it
on their themes and give feedback. If everything is ok, the new extension version will be
released and will appear as update at all Unyson users.
